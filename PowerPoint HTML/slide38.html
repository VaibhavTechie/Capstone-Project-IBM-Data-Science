                <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                <p>This query retrieves records from the SpaceX dataset for the year 2015, specifically focusing on failed landing outcomes on drone ships. This helps in identifying the booster versions and launch sites involved in these failed attempts.</p>
                <h3>Key Elements:</h3>
                <p><strong>Query:</strong> This SQL query selects the month, landing outcome, booster version, and launch site from the SPACEXTABLE where the date is in 2015 and the landing outcome is a failure on a drone ship.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Please see the image for the detailed results of the query on the right side of the slide.</p>
                <h3>Observations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Failure (drone ship):</strong> The failures occurred in January and April 2015.</li>
                    <li><strong>Booster Versions:</strong> The failed attempts involved the F9 v1.1 B1012 and F9 v1.1 B1015 booster versions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Launch Site:</strong> Both failed attempts took place at the CCAFS LC-40 launch site.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
                <p>The data indicates that there were specific challenges faced during drone ship landings in early 2015, which involved particular booster versions and a consistent launch site. This information can be valuable for understanding and addressing the causes of these failures.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Identifying the failed landing outcomes on drone ships in 2015 provides insights into the operational difficulties faced by SpaceX during this period. Analyzing these records helps in pinpointing areas for improvement and refining landing techniques.</p>
