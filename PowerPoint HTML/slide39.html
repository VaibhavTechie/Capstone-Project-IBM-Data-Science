                <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                <p>This query ranks the count of landing outcomes (such as Failure (drone ship) or Success (ground pad)) between the date 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20, in descending order. This helps in understanding the frequency and success rate of different landing outcomes during this period.</p>
                <h3>Key Elements:</h3>
                <p><strong>Query:</strong> This SQL query selects the Landing_Outcome and counts the number of occurrences for each outcome from the SPACEXTABLE within the specified date range, grouping the results by Landing_Outcome and ordering them by the count in descending order.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> Please see the image for the detailed results of the query on the right side of the slide.</p>
                <h3>Observations:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No attempt:</strong> The highest count is for missions with no landing attempt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success (drone ship):</strong> The next highest count is for successful drone ship landings, showing a high rate of successful landings on drone ships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure (drone ship):</strong> The number of failures on drone ships indicates the challenges faced in these landing attempts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Success (ground pad):</strong> A significant number of successful landings on ground pads are also observed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Interpretation:</h3>
                <p>The data indicates that a large number of missions did not attempt a landing, likely earlier missions. Successful drone ship and ground pad landings show the progress in SpaceX's landing technology, while the failures highlight the areas that needed improvement during the period.</p>
                <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
                <p>Ranking the count of landing outcomes between 2010-06-04 and 2017-03-20 provides insights into the development and success rate of SpaceX's landing attempts over time. This analysis helps in understanding the frequency of different outcomes and the evolution of landing techniques.</p>
