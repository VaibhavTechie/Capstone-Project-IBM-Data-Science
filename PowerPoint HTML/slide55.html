            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Preparation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Successfully collected data from various sources, including launch records, economic indicators, and other relevant variables.</li>
                        <li>Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to ensure the models received clean and relevant input.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visualized key trends and patterns in the data, such as the correlation between payload mass and launch success, and the distribution of launch outcomes across different sites.</li>
                        <li>Identified significant features contributing to launch success, such as booster version, payload mass, and launch site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Performance:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN.</li>
                        <li>Decision Tree achieved the highest accuracy of 87.5%, followed by SVM and KNN with 84.82%, and Logistic Regression with 84.64%.</li>
                        <li>Confusion matrices for all models indicated consistent performance, with a similar number of true positives and true negatives.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Insights from Maps and Plots:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mapped global launch sites, highlighting strategic locations and their access to various orbital trajectories.</li>
                        <li>Visualizations indicated that most launch sites are located along coasts to facilitate easier access to orbital paths.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Decision Tree model outperformed others in predicting launch success, suggesting its suitability for this type of classification task.</li>
                        <li>All models were more effective at predicting successful landings compared to predicting failures, indicating a potential area for improvement.</li>
                        <li>Visualization tools such as Folium and plotly provided valuable insights into geographical and statistical aspects of the data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Future Work:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on improving the models' ability to predict failures by refining feature selection and exploring additional machine learning techniques.</li>
                        <li>Continue updating the dataset with new launch records to maintain model accuracy and relevance.</li>
                        <li>Investigate the impact of additional features, such as weather conditions and launch timing, on model performance.</li>
                    </ul>
